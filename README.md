# Basic-CNN-on-CIFAR-10
Building a CNN in TensorFlow to classify images in CIFAR-10 dataset and comparing models with different configurations to see the effect on accuracy.

# Goal 
* To learn handling of image data and pre processing
* See what *Convolutional layers* actually outputs
* See the effect of *maxpool* and *batch normalization* layer
* Train CNN's with different configurations and plot train/test accuracies.

# Layer configurations used
